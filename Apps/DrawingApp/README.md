# Drawing App

Project made during [The Complete Android 12 & Kotlin Development Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/android-kotlin-developer/) by [Denis Panjuta](https://www.udemy.com/user/denispanjuta/).

It's a canvas where you can select a color and draw, you can also select an image from the gallery to be in the background and save the drawing to local storage.
